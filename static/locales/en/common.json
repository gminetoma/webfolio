    "text": "<h2>Hi there! My name is Gustavo Minetoma</h2><p>I'm a <strong>Full-Stack Engineer</strong> based in <em>Kanagawa, Japan</em>. I was born in Japan and moved to Brazil when I was three. My passion for tech began when I first played <strong>Tibia</strong> many years ago. I watched the gaming industry grow, especially one company: <strong>Steam</strong>.</p><p>At 14, I began my career with a <strong>technical course in IT</strong>, followed by a year of mandatory service in the army. After that, I pursued a degree in <strong>System Analysis and Development</strong> at a public college. Once I graduated, I returned to Japan to become financially independent and save funds to continue my tech career.</p><p>Today, I'm a <strong>Teaching Assistant at Code Chrysalis</strong>, where I share my knowledge and experience with students. My goal is to become a <strong>Full-Stack Engineer</strong> and help Brazilian developers build better lives.</p>",
